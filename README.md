AI-Powered Health Risk Assessment with HealthPredictor:
A machine-learning web application called HealthPredictor uses information about a user's vitals, lifestyle, and daily routines to forecast their possible health risk.  It assists users in comprehending how long-term health trends may be influenced by variables such as sleep, stress, steps, screen time, and mood.
onstructed using a trained Random Forest model, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and Python.

 Features:
 uses a trained machine learning model to predict disease risk instantly.
 Clear user interface for entering wellness and personal information
 Interpretation of the risk score in real time
 contains derived features such as mood_score and screen_time.
 Lightweight, quick, and simple to use locally
